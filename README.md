# Sensor Data Analysis 📊

This project is part of my training at **KAITECH** under the "Programming for Engineers" and "Data Analysis" courses.

## 📌 Objective
Analyze sensor readings using Python and visualize the relationships between temperature, stress, and displacement over time.

## 📂 Dataset
```python
sensor_data = [
    ("S1", "2025-04-28 10:00", 35.2, 12.1, 0.002),
    ("S2", "2025-04-28 10:00", 36.5, 14.0, 0.003),
    ("S1", "2025-04-28 11:00", 36.1, 12.5, 0.0021),
    ("S3", "2025-04-28 10:00", 34.0, 11.8, 0.0025),
    ("S2", "2025-04-28 11:00", 37.2, 14.3, 0.0031),
    ("S1", "2025-04-28 12:00", 37.0, 13.0, 0.0022),
